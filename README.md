Perceptron.py is the code of perceptron

Step 1: use pandas to import data.csv, take data.iloc [:,: 5] (the first five columns) as the characteristics of the data, and the last column data ['fetal \ _health '] as the label of the data.

Step 2: data normalization, mapping the distribution of characteristic data to [- 1,1].

Step 3: divide the data set according to 9:1 and set the random seed to 666

Step 4: get the type of data tag and the corresponding one at the same time\_ Hot coding

Step 5: implement the perceptron model: initialize the weights w and B, set the back propagation parameters alpha and beta, and configure num\_ Args and num\_ Class makes the code more widely used. The perceptron class implements the methods of training, evaluation and testing.

Step 6: train 1500 epochs to obtain weights w and b

Step 7: load weights and analyze indicators
